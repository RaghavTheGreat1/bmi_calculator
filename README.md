# BMI Calculator
- Its a simple app that calculates BMI.
- This is a project assigned by my educator Angela Yu. 
- It has been refacatored a lot, so it might not look similar to what Angela has provided.
- Also it has been hosted using GH pages so that all those who check this repo, gets an idea how it functions.
- Prototypes has been added so as to let you distinguish the prototype and the app UI. (Note: The result page looks different than whats actually has been show, this is because I have used a ListView Widget to make it work perfectly fine when device is rotated. I was unable to figure out why I can't wrap it into a Column widget so as to push the bottom bar downwards, but as the course proceeds, I might learn how to do so. But this will be my final commit and the app wont't be reconfigured anytime in near future)
